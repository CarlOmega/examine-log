# Examine Log Plugin for RuneLite (OSRS)

## Description:
The **Examine Log Plugin** enhances the Old School RuneScape (OSRS) experience by allowing players to examine items, NPCs, and objects and track their examine logs. Inspired by the concept of using the "examine" option like a Pokédex, this plugin brings that idea to life, allowing you to catalogue examines with a progress tracker toward collecting all examines in the game.

## Features:
- **Responsive Examine Log UI:** The UI adapts between fixed mode and resizable mode seamlessly, providing a clean and intuitive experience.
- **Track Items, NPCs, and Objects:** Examines are logged and displayed in an organized list, categorized by type (items, NPCs, objects).
- **Progress and Goal Display:** View your current progress and how many examines are still missing, with details like hints and asterisks marking what’s missing.
- **Popup Hints:** Get hints in the examine menu (e.g., items, NPCs, or objects will display an asterisk `(*)` if their examine is not logged). You can also view full hint text to aid in locating missing examines.
- **Hint System:** Provides subtle or detailed hints about missing examines, shown directly in the new log interface.
- **Examine Log Window:** Opens from the character summary window, displaying all logged examines with easy navigation through items, NPCs, and objects.
- **Progress Bar:** See how close you are to completing your entire collection of examines, encouraging the completionist in every player.
- **Resizable & Fixed Mode:** Works seamlessly in both resizable and fixed modes, adapting based on the player’s UI preferences.

## Configuration:
- **Custom Collection Log Popup:** Enables or disables popups each time a new examine log is found. Turn this off if you find the notifications annoying.
- **Custom Examine Log Interface:** Allows you to toggle the custom examine log interface. Turn this off if you don’t want to view the examine logs within the plugin.
- **Examine Log Hint Count:** Controls how many examine texts are displayed after the found ones, before the "... and still more to find" placeholder.
- **Examine Menu Option Hints:** Adds an asterisk `(*)` to the examine menu option when an item, NPC, or object has not yet been examined.
- **Hide Examine Log Text:** Replaces the examine text with `.` for a minimalistic display.
- **Show Full List of Examine Logs:** Toggles displaying every examine log in the game, even if it hasn't been found yet. *Note: Enabling this option may cause lag when opening the log initially.*

## Installation:
1. Open the RuneLite client.
2. Navigate to the Plugin Hub.
3. Search for "**Examine Log**."
4. Click "**Install**."
5. Once installed, you can access the Examine Log from your character summary.

## How to Use:
1. **Examine Items, NPCs, and Objects:** Use the ‘examine’ option on any item, NPC, or object in the game. The plugin will automatically log these examines.
2. **Open Examine Log:** Right-click the character summary to open the new Examine Log interface and track your progress.
3. **Check Hints:** Use the hint system to help guide your search for missing examines. Look for the asterisk `(*)` in the examine menu or use detailed hints provided in the log interface.

## Credits:
- **Data Source:** Uses the Minimal OSRS Item Database for examine data.
- **Inspired By:** A post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1dzrodt/using_the_examine_option_on_absolutely_everything/) about using the examine option as a Pokédex for OSRS, which led to this plugin’s development.
